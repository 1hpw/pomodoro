I think the GUI should have a circle, like a pie chart that ticks like a clock, but shows how much time has passed, and how much time is left.
It could have the time in the middle of it, in a circle within the circle.
it could be XX:XX:XX/XX:XX:XX; but IDK if the screen is wide enough...
Actually just put one on top of the other, and make the "out of" symbol horizontal.
The settings could configure it to be percentages instead of time.
I like the idea of swiping the screen over to a log of tasks/times/ETC.
And swipe in the other direction for the settings.
